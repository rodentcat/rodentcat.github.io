		<h1>ABOUT</h1>
		<p class="centerf"> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- </p>
		<p>So. Who am I? What do I do?
<br /> My name is Elizabeth Sunner. I'm an animator and musician. I'm not very well-known, really... But, I go by the name &quotRODENT-CAT&quot online. At the time of writing this, I have recently rebranded from Pink Mayo to RODENT-CAT. But I neglect to mention the fact that I was only Pink Mayo for about 2 years. Before that, I was RODENT-CAT... Again. But not again, because this was before the change. No no, it was RODENT-CAT to Pink Mayo to RODENT-CAT again.
<br /> <br /> In terms of music, I have two projects, plus one now-defunct one. <a href="https://rodent-cat.bandcamp.com/">RODENT-CAT (general nonsense)</a>, <a href="https://pinkmayo.bandcamp.com/">Pink Mayo (rock nonsense)</a>, and the defunct one, <a href="https://syntheticyou.bandcamp.com/">Synthetic You (electronic nonsense)</a>.
<br /> RODENT-CAT, obviously, is my main project. It's for anything that doesn't fit into the other two. Well, anything that isn't rock, now, since SY is pretty much dead. I have some things planned for RC that should be a nice return to form.
<br /> <br /> What about my animation? Well, in terms of animation... I have Yield No More, that's my main thing. Episode 0 and Episode 1 ARE up, but I've been debating on doing a &quotreset&quot sorta deal, id est, making a new Episode 1 for people to start from. So much has changed since the original Episode 1, so it only makes sense. New art style, new voice actor for Eve, new pacing and general presentation... Yeah.
<br /> Well, I do have another series. Liz Talks. It's just a review show involving an undead cat by the name of &quotElizabeth&quot. Self-insert character, y'know? You can find each episode <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVhFhVXHRYM8KHqwunsAEft5dBurJl1Ll">here.</a>
<br /> <br /> Just a basic rundown of what I do. I also do voice acting, 3D modelling, and now, game development. But you can find pages on this site about those, elsewhere. Oh! And one last thing. At the bottom of every page are links to my stuff. Neat!
